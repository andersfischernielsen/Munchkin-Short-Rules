# Rules

## Setup

- Divide the cards into a treasure stack and a door (AKA room) stack.
- Give each player four cards from each stack. Give each player a level token. Everyone starts at level 1. 

### Cards
- Item cards: Items have a price at the bottom om the card and "_+ some-number_" at the top of the card. 
- Monster cards: Monster cards have a level and name at the top of the card and "_some-number Treasures_" at the bottom. 
- Curse cards: Curse cards have "_Curse!_" at the top of the card.
- Race cards: Race cards have "race" at the bottom of the card.
- Class cards: Race cards have "class" at the bottom of the card.

## Playing

### Starting the Game
- If you have any cards in your hand that are either race or class cards, play them immediately and gain their abilities.
- If you have any item cards and want to equip them you can also do so now.
- Roll the dice. Decide who starts from the die rolls.

### Kick Open the Door
 - Draw a card from the door deck. 
 - If it's a monster - fight it. Then your turn ends. 
 - If it's a curse - it hits you. Then Look For Trouble or Loot the Room.
 - If it's any other card - put it in your hand. Look For Trouble or Loot the Room.

### Look For Trouble or Loot the Room
If you did not fight a monster, choose one of these options:

 - **Look For Trouble:** Choose to play a monster you have in your hand and fight it for levels and treasure. 
 - **Loot the Room:** Choose to loot the "room" you entered and draw another card from the door pile. Keep it in your hand. 

### Charity
When your turn ends, you must have no more than five cards in your hand. If you have more, choose to:

 - Play cards until you're down to five (curses, items etc.)
 - Give cards to the lowest level player until you're down to five cards. If you're the lowest level player, discard cards until you're down to five.

## Combat
 - If your level plus bonuses add up to more than the monster, you win. You only get level(s) from **killing** monster(s), not making them disappear etc. 
 - If you and the monster are tied, or the monster has more than you, you lose. Ask for help, or try to run away. 
 - If more monsters are in the battle, beat their total strength. You can defeat one and try to Run Away from the other, though. 

### Asking For Help
 - Only one player can help you if you cannot defeat a monster by yourself.
 - Players will want some of the treasure if they help. Agree on who gets what and who picks first before helping. 
 - Every bonus the helper can add to the fight applies. 
 - The helper does not gain levels, only treasure, unless a card specifies otherwise.
 - If you cannot defeat the monster(s), you both have to Run Away.

### Running Away
 - Roll the dice. If you get a 5 or more, you escape. If not, read the monster card and do what the "Bad Stuff" is. 
 - You have to Run Away from each separate monster (roll for each monster).

## Items
- Items are not equipped when turned sideways on the table. You can only equip when not in combat. 
- You can only carry one type of item (headgear, armor etc.)
- Selling items for 1000 Gold gets you a level.
- You can only carry one Big item.
- You may not trade items from your hand - only from the table. Traded items must go on the table, too.

## Curses
 - Curses in your hand can be played at any time on any player. 
 - The victim chooses what item a multiple-item curse applies to.
 
## Death
 - If you die, you lose everything except for your level, curses on you, your class and your race.
 - Put every other card you have on the table face up.
 - The other players each pick items, until everything is gone. The highest level players pick first.
 - On your next turn, draw four cards from each deck, like when the game began.

## General Rules

- Cards in front of you are in play (race(s), class(es) curses, items etc.) When a card has been played it cannot be taken back into your hand.
- You can **only** reach level 10 by killing a monster. 
- You can never have a lower level than 1.
- At any time you can: Discard a class or race, play a "Go Up a Level" card, Hireling or curse.
- If you are not in combat, you are able to: Trade items, change equipped items, play a card you just received.
- On your turn you can: Play a new class or race card (any time), sell items for levels (except when you are in combat) and play items.  
- Super Munchkin and Half-Breeds do not suffer penalties for either race/class they are. 
- Treasure cards cannot be played during combat, unless the card(s) says so.
- "Go Up A Level" cards can be used on any player.
- If an undead monster is in battle, any player can add another undead monster to the battle.
